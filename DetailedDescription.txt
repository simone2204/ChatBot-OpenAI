Let's start describing all the libraries used and their main purpose:

JSON: mainly used to save the file name of the PDF documents, in order to make the application remember the last file shared by the user to not reloading it everytime.
OS: used to retrieve API key saved in the system. Copy and paste API key in the code is not reliable.
SYS: used in class "main()" (rows 267 and 270) to initialize the Application PyQt5 and close it with "exit" command.
FITZ: used to read pdf files.
PyQt5: used to create Windows application with a good UI interface, and also for threads and signals.
LANGCHAIN_OPENAI: mainly used for OpenAI Embeddings and ChatOpenAI, in order to use their embeddings and AI models.
LANGCHAIN_COMMUNITY.VECTORSTORES: used for the FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) to create the index of the text. Essential.
LANGCHAIN.TEXT_SPLITTER: used to split the text in chunks.

Now let's describe the flow of the program:

When the application is launched, we are in the "MainWindow()" class (row 105), which inherits from the class "QMainWindow" in order to acquire all the behaviour of a Main Window, such as
toolbar and widgets. Here I initialized two important variables: pdf_text and qa_chain. The first is going to store the text from the document, the latter will be the main chain used
to retrieve informations. We will see better his utility further on. Then i define the model I want to use from OpenAI with "chat_model" variable. I chose GPT-3.5-Turbo model.

The first method is called with initUI():
Here i created the main UI application with PyQt5 widgets. I'm not going to dwell much on this.
