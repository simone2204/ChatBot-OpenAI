Thesis name: "A Langchain agent to support study and learning".
When the program starts, a basic user interface is displayed, allowing users to share a PDF document of various types (mathematics, physics, literature). Once uploaded, the application invites the user to ask any question about the content of the document just shared, and the relevant artificial intelligence (LLAMA or ChatGPT) will receive the most relevant documents from the application about the user's question and process the appropriate responseâ€”the user gains in learning, and the AI gains in reliable and up-to-date information. The PDF is saved in the application even when it is closed, thus saving file loading time and embedding costs.
The software uses APIs from two reference sites, HuggingFace and OpenAI.
The project aims to show how the AI Models integrate their data with reliable updated knowledge from a reputable file (PDF format) shared by a user, and how the latter gains good learning knowledge.
